	**User Characteristics**

		This platform has been designed to be used by aninstructor and a large number of students. An instructor uses this platform to 			add, delete or edit courses using all the features that are available via Studio (CMS). He/she needs to have an idea about the 			basic features of CMS or else one can learn it easily with the user manual as it has a very interactive UI. [1] Students have 			access to the content via LMS and it has been designed such that a large number of students must be able to access the same 			data simultaneously if required. A student must have basic knowledge with surfing the web to be able to do this without much 			trouble.
	
	**Operating Environment**
		A client may use this platform easily on the following operating systems:
			- Ubuntu 12.04 or higher
			- Apple Mac OS X

	**Design and Implementation Constraints**

			- The GUI is available only in English. 
			- Only registered users can access the course content.
			- This is currently available on a single server.
			- It is limited to HTTP/HTTPS.
			- Currently there is no support for installing this platform on Fedora.
			- For installation on Windows, a virtual environment is required. [2]
			- This is meant for a large number of users and deals with very large data, hence an appropriate server and DBMS is 				  required for smooth running. On the client side, one requires some space on the hard disk and a good enough RAM 				  which is now available on almost all the systems.
