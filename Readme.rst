	**Abstracts**
	
		IITBX is a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) being built on the base of edX-platform. As its name
		suggests, the two main features of IITBX are open access and ability to support large scale enrollments. Its
		aim is to provide good quality online education to one and all. It consists of two parts: Learning
		Management System (LMS) and Content Management System (CMS).

		A student who wants to register on IITBX and enroll for a course will be looking at the LMS part of it.
		Every course consists of several video lectures (with subtitles and transcripts), quizzes, assignments,
		studentâ€™s progress report, discussion forums and wiki. An instructor sees and works with the CMS part of
		it. He/she makes use of the several features available to make the course as interactive and engrossing as
		possible.
