Introduction
============

	**Purpose**

		The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the MOOC
		platform. It will explain the purpose and features of the platform, the interfaces of the
		platform, the constraints under which it will have to operate and the technologies used
		to develop this platform. It describes all the functional as well as non-functional
		requirements to develop, use or work on this platform.

	**Project Scope**

		This platform has been designed around the key principles of diversity, openness, interactivity and
		autonomy. It enables access to world-class faculty and an unconventional curriculum. Not only does
		a course contain video lectures and quizzes but also discussion forums for better learning through
		communication. The quizzes are analyzed either by the in-built technologies or through peer-to-peer
		grading which in turn helps the students in acquiring extra skills apart from the course curriculum.
		Though MOOCs are still in experimental stages, participation of many motivated students could
		really bring about a change in our conventional education system.

	**Intended Audience**

		This document is intended for the developers, testers, project managers and most importantly the
		users of this platform.

		The developer will use it to stick to the platformâ€™s actual purpose and not make the system
		inconsistent with its requirements before starting any work on developing the platform. The user
		will use this document to check if he/she has all the required software and specifications before
		installation and use.

		and the constraints faced by the system.
